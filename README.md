📊 Sales Data Analysis using SQL, Python & Power BI
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Python, and Power BI.
The objective is to understand vendor contributions, product performance, and overall sales trends through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server (SSMS): Extracted, cleaned, and structured raw data into usable tables.

Python: Performed data analysis and preprocessing using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Power BI: Built interactive dashboards for data visualization and business insights.

📂 Dataset

The dataset was generated and cleaned in SQL Server (SSMS).

Exported to CSV for further processing in Python and Power BI.

Final processed dataset saved in:

C:\Users\nathm\Downloads\vendor_sales_summary.csv

🔑 Key Features & Insights

Vendor Performance Analysis

Donut chart showing vendor-wise contribution to sales.

Identification of top-performing vendors.

Top 10 Products Analysis

Donut & bar charts showing sales share of top 10 products.

Helps identify best-selling products for decision-making.

Profit Margin Analysis

Python-based calculations for profit margins.

Insights into profitability by vendor and product.

Distribution Analysis

Plotted histograms and density plots for numerical columns.

Understanding sales & profit distribution across dataset.

Interactive Dashboards

Power BI dashboards for sales trends, vendor contribution, and product analysis.

Easy to filter, drill down, and gain insights.

🚀 How to Run the Project
1. SQL Server (SSMS)

Run the provided SQL scripts to create and clean tables.

Export the processed dataset into CSV format.

2. Python

Open Jupyter Notebook / any IDE.

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Run the Python script for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), preprocessing, and charts.

3. Power BI

Import the final CSV dataset into Power BI.

Use Power BI visuals (donut, bar, line charts) to build dashboards.

📊 Dashboards & Visuals

Donut Chart: Vendor contribution in total sales.

Bar Chart: Top 10 products by sales.

Line Chart: Sales trends over time.

Distribution Plots: Sales and profit distribution.

📌 Learning Outcomes
